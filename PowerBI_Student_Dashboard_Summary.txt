Power BI Student Performance Dashboard - Project Summary

1.  Data Loading & Cleaning:

-   Loaded 4 datasets: Students, Scores, Attendance, Behavior.
-   Verified and corrected data types (StudentID as Whole Number, Date
    as Date format).
-   Cleaned column names and handled missing/null values where required.
-   Ensured correct formatting for Score and MaxScore columns.

2.  Data Modeling:

-   Created relationships between: Students[StudentID] ->
    Scores[StudentID] Students[StudentID] -> Attendance[StudentID]
    Students[StudentID] -> Behavior[StudentID]
-   Set relationship type as One-to-Many (1:*).
-   Used Students table as the main dimension table.

3.  DAX Measures Created:

-   % Score = DIVIDE(SUM(Score), SUM(MaxScore))
-   Average Score = AVERAGE(Score)
-   Attendance % = Present Count / Total Attendance
-   Behavior Count = COUNT(BehaviorType)
-   Performance Category using SWITCH (High/Medium/Low)
-   Total Students = DISTINCTCOUNT(StudentID)
-   Avg Attendance KPI
-   Avg % Score KPI

4.  Visualizations Created:

-   Card visuals: Total Students, Average Score, Avg Attendance
-   Bar Chart: Average Score by Subject and Class
-   Line Chart: % Score by Term (Performance Trend)
-   Donut Chart: Behavior Count by Behavior Type
-   Table: Student-wise Score with % Score

5.  Conditional Formatting:

-   Applied conditional formatting on % Score column: >= 80% -> Green
    40%–79% -> Yellow < 40% -> Red

6.  Interactivity Features:

-   Added slicers for Class, Section, Subject, and Term.
-   Enabled drillthrough for Student Profile page.
-   Implemented clean layout and professional formatting.

7.  Final Outcome:

-   Created a fully interactive Student Performance Dashboard.
-   Included KPIs, performance trends, attendance tracking, and behavior
    analysis.
-   Applied professional formatting and logical data modeling.

Project completed successfully with proper data modeling, DAX
calculations, visualization design, and interactivity implementation.
